Distributed Jenkins behind HA Proxy
------------------------------------

1) Create a distributed jenkins server. 
Only jobs folder should be shared on EFS volume. 

2) Test it by creating jobs and then 

Solution:
1) Created isntances , ebs volumes in eu-west-1a Created efs volume and for jenkins created, the text. 
logged into each machine using command below. 
ssh -i awsinaction.pem ec2-user@$(aws ec2 describe-instances --query "Reservations[*].Instances[?State.Name == 'running'].PublicDnsName[]" --output text | awk '{print $2}') 
Ran automat_jhenkins.sh which mounts ebs volume, install jenkins, install nginx and configure a reverse proxy. 

2) logged into jekins for initial password . 
ssh -i awsinaction.pem ec2-user@$(aws ec2 describe-instances --query "Reservations[*].Instances[?State.Name == 'running'].PublicDnsName[]" 
--output text | awk '{print $2}') sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
tyou need not ssh into machine. You can simply run the command. sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/intialAdminPassword.

3) Finally mounted efs volume. 
with script below.
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/jenkins/jobs
sudo yum install -y nfs-utils
Opening port number 2049

# Open port number 2049 in the securiyt group for efs.
# This id should not be used 

# Creating nfs volume. 
sudo bash -c 'cat >> /etc/fstab <<EOF
fs-04067ff5.efs.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com:/ /var/lib/jenkins/jobs nfs4 nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,_netdev 0 0
EOF'
sudo mount -a

4)  Createcd the nfs volume. 

5) On trestaring. had to change the permissions. 
sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/
 
Changed setsebool settings to start the network.  
sudo setsebool httpd_can_network_connect 1

Restarted jenkins. 
sudo systemctl restart jenkins. 


5) One one of the system instead of jenkins user there is jenkins-user. modified it to jenkins.
Still having build failures on python job.

6) 
Bash script to restart jenkins every min on passive master. 
ec2-52-56-171-5.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com will be passive. jenkins-instane2 will be the one. 

eu-west-2a  

This is a good practice book.

Common problems and errors.
------------------------
http://ec2-3-10-226-37.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/


1) for the efs volume, forgot to open the port 2049
2) need to install nfs-utils to use mount command on nfs-stab.

ec2-18-130-227-27.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
ec2-3-10-226-37.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
To login to machine without hard cocding machine name

?State.Name == 'running' acts as a filter on the machines. 

3) when stopping and restarting the machine. you need to remove known_hosts or empty it. 

4) Did not work on red hat enterprise version. So had to use 
Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-032598fcc7e9d1c7a
and yum commands worked. later task is to understand app sync.

sudo mysql -e "CREATE DATABASE graphite;"
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-25-158 ~]$ sudo mysql -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON graphite.* TO 'graphite'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED by 'j3nk1n$db'"
